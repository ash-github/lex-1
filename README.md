lex
===

This is my toy implementation of the lex (the lexcial analyzer).

The code is over 3-years old. I don't have time to maintain it right now, so it may not work as expected.

The LexScanner.h/.cpp LexParser.h/.cpp are for parsing the .l file, they are generated by my lex/yacc themselves (I hardcode the lexical and grammatical rules, please see the project lygen)
